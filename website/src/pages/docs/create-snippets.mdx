# Create snippets

In addition to supporting basic text, PromptSnippets also supports a more powerful type of snippet called Variable Snippets. You can extract the changing parts of a snippet into a variable, and then you only need to fill in this variable.

## Variable Snippets

Use `{{xxx}}` to define a variable, where `xxx` is the name of the variable. For example, `{{count}}` defines a variable snippet named `count`.

You can fill the variables when use this snippet.

Variables also support default value using the `{{name:default}}`. For example, `{{count:1}}` defines a variable snippet named `count`, and the default value is `1`.

ðŸ’¡ Tips: The wrapper symbol of a variable, which are set by default as `{{ }}`, can be customized in the settings.

## Input Mode

There are two ways to fill in variables: `Tab` / `Popup`. You can choose the input mode in the settings.

### Tab

When you use a snippet, you can press `Tab` to fill in the variable. Double `Tab` will select the next variable and fill in the default value.

### Popup

When you use a snippet, an input popup box will appear, containing all the variables initialized with their default value. You can fill in the variable in the popup box.

<Image s="input-popup" width={437} height={238}></Image>
